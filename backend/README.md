# QuantCoder FS â€” LLM powered fundamental analysis and pair-coding for Quantitative Finance

**QuantCoder FS** is an open platform for the design, orchestration, and evaluation of agent-based workflows in quantitative finance. It is developed as part of a research initiative aimed at exploring the use of large language models (LLMs) in tasks such as document summarization, trading strategy automation, fundmental analysis and risk modeling.

This repository contains the **FastAPI server**, **CrewAI agents**, and the architecture supporting **modular research workflows**. While the backend is open-source and intended for collaborative research, the frontend remains private to ensure separation of concerns and limit operational overhead.

## Research Philosophy

QuantCoder FS is not a SaaS product. It is a **thinking environment** â€” a research lab where autonomous agents perform tasks on financial data and documents under controlled conditions.

This design follows a few guiding principles:

- **Reproducibility**: Workflows are modular and agent logic is transparent.
- **Minimalism**: Infrastructure is lightweight, with minimal runtime dependencies.
- **Self-directed Use**: Users bring their own API keys or opt into usage-based credits.
- **Public Experimentation**: Results are visible and replicable; usage does not imply support.

## Repository Structure

The backend is organized for clarity and modularity, with an emphasis on reproducibility and clean agent-based design.

```
backend/
â”œâ”€â”€ agents/        # CrewAI-based autonomous agents
â”œâ”€â”€ core/          # Configuration files, logging, usage tracking
â”œâ”€â”€ models/        # Pydantic schemas for type safety
â”œâ”€â”€ routers/       # API endpoints for each workflow
â”œâ”€â”€ utils/         # Support functions (token parsing, file handling, etc.)
â””â”€â”€ workflows/     # Workflow definitions and orchestration logic
```

Each workflow is developed as a discrete module and follows a shared orchestration pattern. Agents and workflows are designed to be extensible and independently testable.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone and prepare environment

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SL-Mar/quantcoder-backend.git
cd quantcoder-backend
git checkout dev
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt # requirements.windows or requirements.linux
```

### 2. Configure environment variables

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
MODEL_NAME=gpt-4
```

> The system is compatible with all LLMs supported by LangChain depending on availability and keys.

### 3. Launch backend server

```bash
uvicorn backend.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

Interactive API docs will be available at:

## Workflow Example: PDF Summarization

The first implemented workflow focuses on the **summarization of academic or financial PDFs**, enabling rapid extraction of structured insights using LLM-based agents.

This workflow provides:

- Stateless API endpoints for PDF processing
- Agent-based reasoning and summarization logic (CrewAI)
- Output formatted for downstream use or display
- Optional persistence of intermediate and final results

The frontend (not included here) provides a document viewer and summary interface, developed in Next.js and Tailwind. Screenshots are included in articles presenting the project mentionned in references.

## Future Research Modules

QuantCoder_FS is being developed incrementally, with a roadmap focused on evaluating AI-agent performance in common quantitative finance workflows:

- **Fundamental Data Analysis** (via EODHD API)
- **Strategy pair-coding** for QuantConnect/LEAN
- **Risk Modeling** (including VaR and stochastic simulations)
- **Forecasting Pipelines** (e.g., XGBoost)
- **Investment Scoring and Lead Filtering**

Each of these will follow a shared interface, supporting reproducible experimentation and plug-and-play agent design.
